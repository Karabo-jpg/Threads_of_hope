## 🚀 Quick Start - Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

Follow these instructions carefully to set up and run the Threads of Hope application on your local machine.

### Step 1: Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your computer:

1. **Node.js** (version 18.x or higher)
   - Download from: https://nodejs.org/
   - Verify installation by running: `node --version` (should show v18.x or higher)
   - Verify npm is installed: `npm --version`

2. **Supabase Account** (free cloud PostgreSQL database) - **REQUIRED**
   - This project uses Supabase as its database
   - Sign up for a free account at: https://supabase.com
   - Free tier includes: 500MB database, 2GB bandwidth, 50,000 monthly active users
   - **Note**: You can use local PostgreSQL if preferred, but Supabase is recommended and easier to set up

3. **Git** (to clone the repository)
   - Download from: https://git-scm.com/downloads
   - Verify installation: `git --version`

### Step 2: Download the Project

1. **Open your terminal/command prompt** (PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux)

2. **Navigate to the folder where you want to save the project** (e.g., Desktop or Documents)
   ```bash
   cd Desktop
   ```

3. **Clone the repository from GitHub**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Karabo-jpg/Threads_of_hope.git
   ```

4. **Navigate into the project folder**
   ```bash
   cd Threads_of_hope
   ```

   You should now be in the project root directory.

### Step 3: Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the backend folder**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install all backend dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This will take 1-2 minutes. Wait for it to complete successfully.

3. **Create environment configuration file**
   - Copy the example environment file:
     ```bash
     # On Windows (PowerShell):
     Copy-Item .env.example .env
     
     # On Mac/Linux:
     cp .env.example .env
     ```

4. **Configure your database connection (Supabase)**
   - **This project is configured to use Supabase by default**
   - Open the `.env` file in a text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.)
   - **Set up Supabase:**
     1. Go to https://supabase.com and sign up (free account)
     2. Click "New Project"
     3. Choose an organization (or create one)
     4. Fill in project details:
        - Name: `threads-of-hope` (or any name)
        - Database Password: Create a strong password (save this!)
        - Region: Choose closest to you
     5. Wait 2-3 minutes for project to be created
     6. Once created, go to **Project Settings** (gear icon) > **Database**
     7. Find the **Connection string** section
     8. Copy your connection details and update these variables in `backend/.env`:
        ```
        DB_HOST=db.xxxxxxxxxxxxx.supabase.co
        DB_PORT=5432
        DB_NAME=postgres
        DB_USER=postgres
        DB_PASSWORD=your-supabase-database-password
        ```
     - **Example `.env` file:**
       ```
       DB_HOST=db.abcdefghijklmnop.supabase.co
       DB_PORT=5432
       DB_NAME=postgres
       DB_USER=postgres
       DB_PASSWORD=MySecurePassword123!
       JWT_SECRET=mySecretKey123!@#
       FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
       ```
   - **Alternative: Using Local PostgreSQL** (if you prefer):
     - Install PostgreSQL from https://www.postgresql.org/download/
     - Create a database named `threadsofhope`
     - Update `.env` with:
       ```
       DB_HOST=localhost
       DB_PORT=5432
       DB_NAME=threadsofhope
       DB_USER=postgres
       DB_PASSWORD=your-local-postgres-password
       ```
   - **Set JWT secret** (any random string, e.g., `mySecretKey123!@#`):
     ```
     JWT_SECRET=your-random-secret-key-here
     ```
   - **Set frontend URL** (for CORS):
     ```
     FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
     ```

5. **Create database tables**
   ```bash
   npm run sync:db
   ```
   You should see: `✅ All tables created successfully!`

6. **Seed test accounts** (optional, for testing)
   ```bash
   npm run seed:test-accounts
   ```

7. **Start the backend server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   You should see: `Server running on port 5000` or similar.

   **Keep this terminal window open** - the backend must stay running.

### Step 4: Frontend Setup

1. **Open a NEW terminal/command prompt window** (keep the backend running in the first terminal)

2. **Navigate to the project root, then into frontend folder**
   ```bash
   cd path/to/Threads_of_hope/frontend
   ```
   (Replace `path/to` with your actual path)

3. **Install all frontend dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This will take 2-3 minutes. Wait for it to complete.

4. **Create environment configuration file**
   ```bash
   # On Windows (PowerShell):
   Copy-Item .env.example .env
   
   # On Mac/Linux:
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. **Configure frontend environment**
   - Open the `.env` file in the frontend folder
   - Set the backend API URL:
     ```
     REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
     ```

6. **Start the frontend development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Your browser should automatically open to `http://localhost:3000`
   - If it doesn't open automatically, manually go to: http://localhost:3000

### Step 5: Verify Installation

1. **Check that both servers are running:**
   - Backend: Terminal 1 should show the server is running
   - Frontend: Terminal 2 should show "Compiled successfully!" and your browser should be open

2. **Test the application:**
   - You should see the login page in your browser
   - Try logging in with test credentials (see Default Credentials section below)

3. **If you see errors:**
   - Check that both terminals show no error messages
   - Verify your database connection in the backend `.env` file
   - Make sure both servers are running (backend on port 5000, frontend on port 3000)

### Troubleshooting

**Problem: "npm install" fails**
- Solution: Make sure you have Node.js 18+ installed. Try deleting `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install` again.

**Problem: "Cannot connect to database"**
- Solution: Double-check your database credentials in `backend/.env`. If using Supabase, make sure your project is active and the password is correct.

**Problem: Frontend shows "Network Error"**
- Solution: Make sure the backend is running on port 5000. Check `backend/.env` has `FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000`.

**Problem: Port already in use**
- Solution: Another application is using port 3000 or 5000. Close other applications or change the port in the configuration files.

**Problem: Tables not created**
- Solution: Run `npm run sync:db` again in the backend folder. Check your database connection first.

### Alternative: Using Docker (Advanced)

If you have Docker installed, you can run everything with one command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start both backend and frontend automatically. However, you still need to configure the `.env` files as described above.

### ✅ Setup Complete - What You Should See

When everything is set up correctly:

1. **Backend Terminal** should show:
   ```
   ✅ Database connection established successfully.
   Server running on port 5000
   ```

2. **Frontend Terminal** should show:
   ```
   Compiled successfully!
   webpack compiled successfully
   ```

3. **Browser** should automatically open to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
   And display the Threads of Hope login page.

4. **You can now log in** using the test credentials below.

If you see all of the above, congratulations! Your setup is complete and the application is running successfully. 🎉

## 🔑 Default Credentials
